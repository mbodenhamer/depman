A lightweight dependency manager for managing project dependencies in multiple contexts. The use case driving development is that of distinguishing between development, testing, and production dependencies in a simple and unified way. However, the application is general purpose and can be used in any project requiring the management of dependencies in multiple contexts.

Currently, only dependencies resolved via ``apt-get`` and ``pip`` are supported.  However, support for other dependency types is planned for future releases (see `Future Features`_ for more details).

Installation
------------
::

    $ pip install depman


Usage
-----
::

    usage: depman [-h] [-f <depfile>] [-t <type>] [-o <outfile>] [--no-header]
		  <command> [<context>]

    A lightweight dependency manager.

    positional arguments:
      <command>             'satisfy' satisfies the dependencies specified in
			    <depfile>. 'validate' only validates <depfile> and
			    does not perform any system operations. 'export'
			    exports requirements to a specified file (using -o)
      <context>             The dependency context to perform <command> on

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -f <depfile>, --depfile <depfile>
			    The requirements file to load
      -t <type>, --type <type>
			    Restrict operations to dependencies of this type
      -o <outfile>, --outfile <outfile>
			    File to write results to
      --no-header           No export header

If not supplied, ``<depfile>`` and ``<context>`` default to ``requirements.yml`` and ``all``, respectively.

Example(s)
----------

Suppose you have the following ``requirements.yml`` in your current working directory
::

    includes:
      dev:
	- test

    dev:
      apt:
	- libxml2-dev=2.9.1+dfsg1-5+deb8u2
	- libxslt1-dev
      pip:
	- lxml
	- Sphinx

    test:
      pip:
	- nose
	- coverage

    prod:
      pip:
	- gevent:
	    version: <=1.0.2
	- texttable
	- six:
	    always_upgrade: yes
	- syn>=0.0.10

      yatr:
	- cleanup:
	    yatrfile: provisioning_tasks.yml


This file specifies three dependency contexts: ``dev``, ``test``, ``prod``.  In general, any top-level key in ``requirements.yml`` specifies a dependency context.  The one exception to this rule is ``includes``, which defines inclusion relationships between contexts.  In this example, the ``dev`` context includes the ``test`` context.  As such, when ``depman satisfy test`` is run at the command line, ``depman`` will invoke ``pip`` to install ``nose`` and ``coverage``, if they do not exist on the system.  On the other hand, when ``depman satisfy dev`` is run at the command line, ``depman`` will first invoke ``apt-get`` to install ``libxml1-dev`` (version ``2.9.1+dfsg1-5+deb8u2``) and ``libxslt1-dev`` and then invoke ``pip`` to install ``lxml``, ``Sphinx``, ``nose``, and ``coverage`` (in general, ``apt`` dependencies are processed before ``pip`` dependencies).  Because ``test`` is "included" in ``dev``, its dependencies are processed whenever ``dev`` is processed.
    
``depman`` also accepts the special context ``all`` as a valid command line parameter.  Running ``depman satisfy all`` causes ``depman`` to satisfy the dependencies in all of the defined dependency contexts.  In this example, it would cause ``depman`` to satisfy the dependencies for ``dev``, ``test``, and ``prod``.  Running ``depman satisfy`` is equivalent to running ``depman satisfy all``.

Currently, only three dependency types are supported in any context: ``apt``, ``pip``, and ``yatr``.  However, support for other dependency types is planned for future releases (see `Future Features`_ for more details).
    
Dependencies are specified in each context under each dependency type as YAML list elements.  If the element is a string, the dependency in question will be treated as satisfied if some version of the package denoted by the string exists on the system.  For more detailed dependency requirements, the name of the package can be listed as the key to a YAML dictionary of dependency options.  This can be seen, for example, in the ``gevent`` dependency, in which a version less than of equal to ``1.0.2`` is specified as a requirement.  Additionally, the ``six`` package contains the ``always_upgrade`` option, which causes ``depman`` to always attempt to upgrade the package, regardless of the current version installed.  

Package version relations can be specified in various ways.  In the ``prod`` context, ``pip`` is constrained to only install a version of ``syn`` that is greater than or equal to ``0.0.10``.  Likewise, in the ``dev`` context, ``apt`` is constrained to install version ``2.9.1+dfsg1-5+deb8u2`` of ``libxml2-dev``.  And, as seen above, the ``pip`` ``gevent`` dependency is constrained to a version less than or equal to ``1.0.2``

The ``yatr`` dependency is a special type that will invoke yatr_ to execute the specified task from the specified ``yatrfile``.  In this example, the ``prod`` context specifies that a task named ``cleanup`` defined in ``provisioning_tasks.yml`` is to be run.  ``yatr`` "dependencies" are not true dependencies, but task invocations, and thus cannot truly be satisfied.  As a result, invoking ``depman`` to satisfy a ``yatr`` dependency will always cause the task defined therein to be executed.  By default, ``yatr`` tasks will only run after all other dependencies have been satisfied.  ``yatr`` dependencies can be used to perform scripted installs, cleanup and provisioning actions, and other tasks that are otherwise beyond the scope of a lightweight dependency manager.

Export
~~~~~~

Dependencies can also be exported.  In this example, running
::

    depman export prod -t pip -o requirements.txt

will produce a file ``requirements.txt`` in the current directory that looks like::

    # Auto-generated by depman 0.3.3
    gevent<=1.0.2
    six
    syn>=0.0.10
    texttable

The header comment can be suppressed by supplying the ``--no-header`` option.
